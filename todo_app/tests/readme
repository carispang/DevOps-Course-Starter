Running Tests
Tests are stored in the 'tests' subfolder. Unit tests are in trello_items_test.py and 
integration tests are kept in client_test.py.
Test Explorer UI and pytest should be installed. 
The tests run using pytest.
Pytest will need to be configured to use the correct working directory.
When using pytest you are able to run the tests individually by clicking 
the run button which appears over the test in the testing script. 
Alternatively, you can run all of the tests in a script by clicking the run button in the 
Test Explorer. You can also run them individually from the Test Explorer pane.
You can run the tests from the terminal by typign poetry run pytest.
